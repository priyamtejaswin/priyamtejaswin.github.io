Hello! My name is Priyam. I am a Data Scientist at [Flipkart.com](https://www.flipkart.com/).
I enjoy solving challenging problems using machine-learning and large-scale datasets. What's machine-learning I hear you say? Well, [look no further](https://xkcd.com/1838/).

I created this website to organise and track my personal projects (many of which are gathering dust in the `ye_olde_projectz` directory). Some of these are overnight hacks [(Monkeys Typing Shakespeare)](https://github.com/priyamtejaswin/c00lHaX/blob/master/monkey_typing_shakespeare.py), others are more ambitious which just don't seem to end [(Learning to Transduce)](https://github.com/priyamtejaswin/learning-to-transduce#learning-to-transduce--using-a-modular-extensible-framework-that-we-created).

I also wanted to organise my notes on academic papers; I tend to keep a track my readings in different Markdown files. Again, these range from simple summaries of an interesting paper [(Isolation Forests)](https://hackmd.io/s/H1ZPXOq8m) to dense reviews of a single concept [(Adversarial Examples)](https://hackmd.io/s/By8Pu47af).

Drop a note if you found something to be helpful!
