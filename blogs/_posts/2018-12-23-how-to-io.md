I enjoy documenting my work. That was reason enough to start all this. 
Wordpress as a blog/CMS was suggested by some friends, but I never liked that platform. Something about it felt *dishonest*; like it was made for and designed by people who use Windows. Wanting to avoid the pains of self-hosting and writing good CSS, I started writing rather elaborate `jupyter`(alias `ipython`) notebooks, replete with Markdown, Mathjax, images and GIFs. 

Notebooks were my 2nd choice. I would have preferred simply writing Markdown files and publishing them with the repo but Github does not allow rendering Latex or Mathjax. There are hacks which first process your Mathjax/Latex and render SVGs which you can then link as images to your MD file. But those were clunky.

</div>

The notebook has it's own set of issues, but it gets the job done. Using some Javascript, you could even hide all the `code` input cells. My only pet peeve (and yes, I am nitpicking here) was the way Github renders the content in it's explorer. `nbviewer` provided a far superior viewing experience. With that, I compromised. I would finish my project, add all supporting commentary, Math, references and figures, render using `nbviewer` and then add this link link to the project's README.
