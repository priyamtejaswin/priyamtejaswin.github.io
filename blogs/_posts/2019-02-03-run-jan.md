22 runs, 114.81 km, 5'05"/km. Missed 9 runs.
- 3 days, offsite
- 2 Sundays, relatives
- 4 days, slacked

I was doing a lot of shorter runs initially (around 4-5 km) partly because I had stopped running for some months and also because I was running at night. There was a sudden temperature drop in the first week of January. I thought my body would be more accustomed to the temperature towards the end of the day instead of jumping out to run straight from bed. It's working fine so far.

I can cover 7km non-stop everyday within 38 minutes comfortably now. I've tried increasing my pace, but it's not been sustainable yet. In time perhaps...

I also discovered a weird bug in the Nike+ Run Club app. If you end a run AFTER midnight (like my last run on 31st Jan), it will register it as a run for the *next day's evening*.
